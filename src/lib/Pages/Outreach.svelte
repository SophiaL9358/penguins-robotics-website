            <b><i>Hosting the First Lego League Festival</i></b>
            <br><br>
            In early January, our team was given the unique opportunity to host the official FIRST Lego League Explore Festival, along with the Rockville Science Center. Throughout the event, we were able to inform many students and parents about FTC and explained how our robot worked.

            <b><i>Scrimmages</i></b>
            <br><br>
            Our team participated in many scrimmages with other teams throughout the season. We had a lot of fun interacting with other teams and learned a lot from their robots.

            In addition, we were also able to host our own scrimmage, inviting teams such as Orca Robotics and Thunderstone.        </div>

            <b><i>Preseason</i></b>
            <br><br>
            After our 2021-2022 season ended for us, we moved our focus to outreach and making an impact in our community.
            <br><br>
            During the summer of 2022, we reached out to the community and taught at a robotics summer camp which lasted many weeks. Our goal was to promote STEM and robotics within our local community and inspire people who didnâ€™t have any experience in STEM.
            <br><br>
            Our team also was able to introduce FIRST, but particularly FTC, to students at Veritas Collegiate Academy. While there, we guided them through building and programming basic FTC robots.
